Marlin (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1047.pdf) presents a new zk-SNARKs protocol with the benefit of the updateability of its Universal SRS (structured reference string) with the size linear in the size of the arithmetic circuit that describes the computational statement being proven. URS is statement/circuit independent and can be used for the proofing system of many circuits whose size (depth) is limited by the URS size. Marlin provides the benefit of succinctness of the proofs and of the proof verification.

The source code of this repository implements the Marlin proofing system.
